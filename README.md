# libnotify

Send desktop notifications.

## Description

libnotify is a library for sending desktop notifications to a notification
daemon, as defined in the [org.freedesktop.Notifications][fdo-spec] Desktop
Specification. These notifications can be used to inform the user about an event
or display some form of information without getting in the user's way.

It is also a simple wrapper to send cross-desktop Notifications for sandboxed
applications using the [XDG Portal Notification API][portal].

### Documentation

You can find the nightly documentation at https://gnome.pages.gitlab.gnome.org/libnotify/.

## Notice

For GLib based applications the [GNotification][gnotif] API should be used
instead.
